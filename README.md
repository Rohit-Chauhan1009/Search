Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple searching algorithm used to find the position of a target value within an array or a list. It sequentially checks each element of the array until either the target value is found or the entire array has been traversed.

The linear search algorithm works as follows:

1) Start from the first element of the array.
2) Compare the current element with the target value.
3) If the current element matches the target value, the search is successful, and the position or index of the element is returned.
4) If the current element does not match the target value, move to the next element in the array.
5) Repeat steps 2-4 until either the target value is found or the end of the array is reached.
6) If the end of the array is reached without finding the target value, the search is considered unsuccessful, and a sentinel value (e.g., -1) is often returned to indicate that the target value is not present in the array.

Linear search is a straightforward algorithm, but its efficiency is relatively low compared to more advanced search algorithms like binary search or hash-based searches. In the worst-case scenario, when the target value is at the end of the array or not present at all, linear search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This means that the time taken to perform the search increases linearly with the size of the array.

Linear search is most suitable for small arrays or unsorted lists where efficiency is not a primary concern. It is easy to implement and understand, making it a good choice for simple search tasks. However, for large arrays or when efficiency is crucial, more optimized search algorithms should be used.
